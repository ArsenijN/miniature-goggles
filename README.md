Test website (my first work. In progress...)
Documentation on using EnderCast. Changes will most likely be every week.


EnderCast dev 0.5 v.0.2.0.0c_3

Changes:
* Some processing of the Start menu (but it is still raw, only animation has been done)
* Appearance: now the icons are 50% smaller than the original
* Dynoswap dinosaur now jumps smoothly

What hasn't been done yet:
* Translation of internal text into English
* Adding clock and calendar
* Size optimization


THIS IS THE DEVELOPER VERSION. POSSIBLE SERIOUS ERRORS IN THE WORK OF THE PROJECT.
